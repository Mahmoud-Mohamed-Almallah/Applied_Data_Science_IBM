ðŸš€ Excited to share my data science project: Predicting Rocket Reusability (IBM Capstone)
As space exploration advances, reusing rocket components like the first stage has become crucial for reducing costs. In this project, I analyzed data to predict the price and accuracy of reusing the first stage of rockets, leveraging Python libraries like Pandas, SQL, Matplotlib, folium and Scikit-learn.
The Challenge:
Reusing the first stage of rockets is a game-changer for the aerospace industry, but determining the feasibility of reuse is complex. My goal was to build a model that predicts the successful landing of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and it lead to save $100 million USD. evaluates the accuracy of reusing the first stage based on historical data.
My Approach:
Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset using Pandas and SQL.
Visualized trends and relationships using Matplotlib and folium.
Interactive Dashboard using plotly.
Built predictive models using Scikit-learn to estimate reuse accuracy.
_Key Insights_:
The cost of reusing the first stage decreases significantly after multiple launches.
Certain features, like Flight Number, Payload Mass, Launch Site, Orbit, Class and Year, have a strong impact on reuse accuracy.
My model achieved an accuracy of 83.33% in predicting reuse feasibility.
